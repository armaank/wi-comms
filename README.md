Simulations & Projects for ECE408: Wireless Communications

All simulations are written in MATLAB2019b

The only requirement to run the program is the comms toolbox

### Project 1: Simple Wireless Link
Simulating QAM, equalizing channels and error control coding

You can find my full report ![here](simple_link/report/report.pdf).

### Project 2: Alamouti Codes
Simulating transmitter space-time diversity for Rayleigh flat-fading channels

You can find my full report ![here](alamouti/report/report.pdf).

### Project 3: CDMA
Building a simple CDMA receiver to decode a secret message

You can find my full report ![here](cdma/report/report.pdf).

### Project 4: MIMO-OFDM
Simulating a subset of the OFDM 802.11a standard, a MIMO link and an MIMO-OFDM system

You can find my ful report ![here](mimo_ofdm/report/report.pdf).
