\section{Introduction}
We simulate three different wireless links. First, we verify simulating 4QAM and 16QAM simulations match theoretical bit error rate (BER) curves. Next, we design an adaptive equalizer to mitigate inter-symbol-interference over a wireless channel and achieve a BER less than $10^{-4}$ at 12dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for BPSK. Finally, we use error correcting codes to maximize bit rate and achieve a BER less than $10^{-6}$ at 12dB SNR.

\section{4QAM \& 16QAM Performance}
We were able to successfully match theoretical performance for both 4 and 16-ary QAM schemes over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels. 

We simulated performance by computing the bit error rate for a single 1000 symbol packet, averaged over 10 iterations. BER curves and constellation diagrams for 4QAM can be seen in Fig. \ref{4ber} and \ref{4star}. BER curves and constellation diagrams for 16QAM can be seen in Fig. \ref{16ber} and \ref{16star}

\section{Equalizing a Moderate ISI Channel}
Next, we attempt to equalize a frequency selective channel that introduces ISI, using a BPSK modulation scheme. We attempted several different adaptive filtering algorithms in an attempt to equalize the channel. Generally speaking, we found RLS based algorithms difficult to stabilize, and linear equalizers tended to require long training sequences. We found that we achieved the best performance using a decision feedback equalizer (DFE) with a signed-LMS algorithm.

We simulated the channel with $100,000$ symbols in order to ensure we met the performance specification of a BER less than $10^{-4}$ at 12dB, averaged over five iterations.

\caption{BPSK constellation}
\label{16star}
\end{figure}
We were able to successfully meet the specification, achieving a BER of approximately $10^{-6}$ at 12dB SNR.
\section{Maximizing Bit Rate via Coding}
Finally, we attempted to further improve the performance of our wireless communication system by introducing error control codes. In order to maximize bit rate while still achieving the $10^{-6}$ BER requirement at 12dB SNR, we decided to increase the order of modulation and use turbo codes. 

We used 16QAM and a code rate of $\frac{2}{3}$ for the turbo codes. We generated the BER curve in Fig. \ref{turbo} using the standard 1000 symbol packet, averaged over five iterations. We were able to achieve a 2.667 bits per symbol, yielding a bit rate of 2666 bits per 1000 symbol packet.

\section{Conclusion}
We were able to successfully demonstrate understanding of communication theory fundamentals. We simulated AWGN and frequency selective channels, and corrected ISI both via adaptive equalization and error correcting codes.
